## All About Me
Most people call me Ri. I was born in July of 2001. I am a student at Apex Friendship High School. In love with volleyball, dogs, and shoes. I spend most of my time with family and friends. My bestfriends are Lydia and Kailyn who say I can be shy and quiet but when you to know me I'll become way crazier than you expected.
